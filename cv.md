## About myself:
Hi! My name is Yulia and I'm 25 years old. I have an architectural education. However obtaining some real design experience, i've understood that i like to deal with technoligies more. So for the last year I work as a BIM-Coordinator. It's a specialist who help disigners to build information 3d-models of buildings, teach them to work with the modelling software and test building models. As I work a lot with an information data of building elements and automate some design processes, I've decided to develop in the field of programming. I am very grateful to study on the Front-end course of RS School.
